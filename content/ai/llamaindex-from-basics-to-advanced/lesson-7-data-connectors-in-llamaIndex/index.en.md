description: This article provides an overview of "Readers" in LlamaIndex, a powerful tool for connecting and processing data from many different sources. Each Reader is designed to retrieve data from specific formats and sources such as local files, databases, remote file systems, and online platforms such as Discord, Slack, GitHub, and Twitter. Detailed descriptions of each Reader's functions help users clearly understand how to use them to optimize data management and querying.

### Data Connectors (LlamaHub)

Data connectors (also known as Readers) are essential tools for retrieving data from various sources and formats, transforming them into simple `Document` representations with text and basic metadata.

**Tip:** Once you've retrieved the data, you can build an `Index` on it, ask questions using the `Query Engine`, and interact through the `Chat Engine`.

### LlamaHub

Our data connectors are provided through **LlamaHub** ðŸ¦™, an open-source repository containing data loaders that you can easily plug into any LlamaIndex application.

## Usage Pattern

Each data loader has a "Usage" section that demonstrates how to use it. At the core of every loader's usage is the `download_loader` function, which downloads the loader file into a module that you can use in your application.

**Example Usage:**

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, download_loader
from llama_index.readers.google import GoogleDocsReader

gdoc_ids = ["1wf-y2pd9C878Oh-FmLH7Q_BQkljdm6TQal-c1pUfrec"]
loader = GoogleDocsReader()
documents = loader.load_data(document_ids=gdoc_ids)
index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(documents)
query_engine = index.as_query_engine()
query_engine.query("Where did the author go to school?")
```

1.  `download_loader`: This function is used to download and install the specific data loader you want to use. In this example, we download `GoogleDocsReader` to work with Google Docs documents.
2.  `load_data`: After initializing the loader, you use the `load_data` method to retrieve data from the source. In this case, you provide a list of `document_ids` (IDs of Google Docs) to specify which documents to load.
3.  `VectorStoreIndex.from_documents`: The retrieved data is returned as a list of `Document` objects. You use this function to build a vector index from these documents, enabling semantic search.
4.  `as_query_engine`: Converts the index into a query engine, allowing you to ask questions about the content of the documents.
5.  `query`: Use the query engine to search for information in the index. In this example, we ask, "Where did the author go to school?"
