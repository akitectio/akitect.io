## Introduction

MAAS (Metal as a Service) is a powerful cloud hardware management solution, providing remote automation for bare metal. MAAS allows you to provision physical servers, virtual machines, and network devices for your applications, offering a modern approach to managing your infrastructure.

MAAS is a part of the OpenStack ecosystem, but it can also be used independently. MAAS can be used to manage physical servers, virtual machines, and network devices, offering a modern approach to managing your infrastructure.

## Key Features of MAAS

- Cloud hardware management
- Physical server management
- Virtual machine management
- Network device management
- Infrastructure management

## Components of MAAS

{{< figure src="./images/components-of-maas.png" >}}

MAAS has 3 main components:

- **MAAS Server**: This is the main server that contains the MAAS installation. It houses both the Region Controller and the Rack Controller.

- **MAAS Region Controller**: This is the main component of MAAS. It provides the user interface, API, and it manages the provisioning and distribution of the operating system.

- **MAAS Rack Controller**: The Rack Controller provides local network services (such as DHCP, TFTP, HTTP) to the physical servers. Each Rack Controller connects to a Region Controller and provides services to a specific "rack" of servers.
