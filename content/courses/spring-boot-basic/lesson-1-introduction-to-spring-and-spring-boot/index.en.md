#### 1. Introduction to Spring Framework

-   **History and Evolution**:
    -   **Origins**: Spring Framework was created by Rod Johnson and first released in 2003. This framework was developed to address the complexities of earlier Java EE technologies, such as EJB (Enterprise JavaBeans), by providing a simpler and more flexible programming model.
    -   **Key Development Stages**: Discuss the major versions of Spring, from Spring Framework 1.0 to the current version, highlighting significant improvements such as support for annotations, integration with Spring Boot, and reactive programming support.

-   **Core Concepts and Philosophy**:
    -   **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Explain in detail what dependency injection is and how it helps reduce coupling between software components, thereby increasing modularity and reusability of code. Provide a code example demonstrating how to configure a bean in Spring using DI.
    -   **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Describe how AOP helps separate cross-cutting concerns (such as logging or transaction management) from the main business logic of the application. Provide a simple example of how to apply AOP in a Spring application.

-   **Components and Modules of Spring**:
    -   **Spring MVC**: Introduce Spring MVC and explain how it facilitates the development of web applications using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. Describe how to create a simple controller and handle web requests.
    -   **Spring Data**: Discuss Spring Data and how it simplifies data access from various data sources such as JPA, MongoDB, or JDBC.
    -   **Spring Security**: Explain the robust authentication and authorization capabilities of Spring Security, including an example of securing a web application.

#### 2. Introduction to Spring Boot

-   **What is Spring Boot?**:
    -   Define and explain how Spring Boot accelerates development by eliminating boilerplate configuration tasks. Describe the concept of "opinionated defaults" that Spring Boot applies to minimize configuration time.

-   **Key Features**:
    -   **Auto-configuration**: Provide details about the auto-configuration mechanism of Spring Boot, including examples of how Spring Boot selects the best configuration based on the project's dependencies.
    -   **Standalone Applications and Embedded Servlet Containers**: Discuss the benefits of having an embedded web server directly within the application, allowing for easy and quick deployment.
    -   **Spring Boot Actuator**: Introduce Spring Boot Actuator in detail, including the endpoints it provides for monitoring and managing applications in production environments.
