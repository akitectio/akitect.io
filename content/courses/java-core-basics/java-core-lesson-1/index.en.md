Java is a high-level, versatile, object-oriented, and secure programming language developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems, Inc. in 1991. It was originally called Oak. In 1995, Sun Microsystems renamed it to Java. In 2009, Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation.

# Features of Java

1. Simple: Java is a simple language because its syntax is simple, clear, and easy to understand. Complex and ambiguous concepts of C++ are either eliminated or re-implemented in Java. For example, pointer overloading and operator overloading are not used in Java.
2. Object-Oriented: In Java, everything is in the form of objects. It means that it has some data and behavior. A program must have at least one class and object.
3. Robust: Java strives to check errors at runtime and compile time. It uses a strong memory management system called garbage collector. Exception handling and garbage collection features make it powerful.
4. Secure: Java is a safe programming language because it does not have pointers and programs run explicitly in a virtual machine. Java contains a security manager that determines the access rights of Java classes.
5. Platform-Independent: Java ensures that code is written once and runs everywhere. This bytecode is platform-independent and can run on any machine.
6. Portable: Java bytecode can be taken to any platform. There are no implementation-dependent features. Everything related to storage is predetermined, for example, the size of its primitive data types.
7. High Performance: Java is an interpreted language. Java allows high performance by using the Just-In-Time compiler.
8. Distributed: Java also has networking capabilities. It is designed for the distributed environment of the internet because it supports the TCP/IP protocol. It can run over the internet. EJB and RMI are used to create a distributed system.
9. Multi-threaded: Java also supports multithreading. It means that it can process more than one task at a time.

# Lifecycle of Java

A Java application has 5 stages:

1. Code/Text Editor: The developer will design the program's statements, structures, and algorithms and save them to the .java file.
2. Java Compiler: Compiles the program into bytecode.
3. Class Loader: Reads the files containing bytecode and stores them in RAM.
4. Bytecode Verifier: Ensures that the bytecode is valid and has no security risks according to Java standards.
5. Interpreter: Compiles the program into machine code, so that the program can be executed and the program can be executed.

# Basic Terminology in Java

1. Class: A class is a blueprint (plan) that represents a class (object). It can be defined as a pattern that describes data and behavior associated with its version.
2. Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is an entity with behavior and state.
   - Example: A car is an object with attributes such as brand, color, and license plate.
   - Behavior: Running on the road.
3. Method: The behavior of an object is a method.
   - Example: A fuel gauge tells the remaining fuel in the car.
4. Instance variables: Each object has a unique set of instance variables. The state of an object is usually created by values assigned to these instance variables.

## So I have introduced the main components of Java Core, if there is anything missing, please let me know, Thank you.
